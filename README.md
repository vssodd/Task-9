# Task-9

Task-9 consists of a variety of Python scripts focused on generating patterns, working with numbers, and practicing control structures like loops and conditionals. The main themes include:

Printing numeric and character-based patterns, such as tables, pyramids, frames, and symmetric designs.

Handling user inputs for dimensions and counts to dynamically control output shapes.

Working with number sequences, including prime number detection and digit sum calculations.

Using nested loops effectively to create visually structured outputs.

Applying logic to align and space elements properly, like tabbing and spacing in pyramids.

Demonstrating basic algorithms for pattern creation and number manipulation.

The collection of tasks serves as solid practice for mastering iterative constructs, conditional logic, and string/number operations in Python.
